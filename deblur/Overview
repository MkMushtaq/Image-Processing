The de_blur.m takes the cameraman image and adds blur to it and then deblurs it again. On inputting the time the image starts to deblur; more the time more the deblur. 
However a big time input value can also distort the image, hence you can input an optimal value of 1 second.
The original, blurred and deblurred image would be shown in a figure.
